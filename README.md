Heart related issues/Disease -(Bio-Tech-Market-segmentation)
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases.It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
Attribute Information:

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.

Disability Affected Life Years (DALYs) is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death. While the rate of DALYs for ischemic heart disease was 3,062 per 100,000 people for India, it was the highest in Punjab (5,759) followed by Tamil Nadu (4,788) and Haryana (4,244). Other states with higher DALYs than the national average were Andhra Pradesh (4,023), Maharashtra (3,658), Karnataka (3,892) and Gujarat (3,736).
